<h1>Aegia Aeterna - Heliadora </h1>
<p>
Heliadora means "gift of the sun" in the local tongue. 
</p>
<p>
Marble forums and vow-stones decorate the antique capital of democracy, where once great people stood.
Due to all the nostalgia around these times back then, the structures are kept meticulously. 
Don't let them catch you mistreating the monuments, that is if you don't like fines in the Millions...

The Aegians all love their pizza, so swing by the restaurant "Capitolo" to get a taste. 
Though they're sure to taste not even close to Mama's good ol' pizza pie, you are sure to find your tastes anew.
Keep a good portion of money on you, though... Those touristy hot-spots jack up the prices tenfold. 
Worth it? We'll let you decide.
