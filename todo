Project definition of done:
- Every country has a reason to explore it
- Pet interactions should feel meaningful
- Daily rewards should let the player come back without feeling like a live service game
- Either fully delve into the mature elements (gore/sex/mental health/addictions) or keep it child friendly
- Redo random events to not let players spam refresh to get them

	11.3. Signature move for each pet species line to improve identity
	11.4. Evolution/ascension choices with tradeoffs, not strict upgrades

12. Scope guardrails (what to avoid in v1)
	12.1. Avoid real-time PvP netcode in first release (start with async friend battles)
	12.2. Avoid too many minigames at launch (ship 2 polished games, add more later)
	12.3. Avoid giant country map upfront (release 2-3 dense countries first)
	12.4. Avoid complex player economy initially (NPC economy first, player trading later)
